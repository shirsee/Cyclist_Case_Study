## Scenario
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to
any other station in the system anytime. 

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: 
* Single-ride passes (casual riders)
* Full-day passes (casual riders)
* Annual memberships (members)

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the company believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, the company believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. Casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. The company believes the future success depends on maximizing the number of annual membership

## Questions
* How do annual membership and casual riders user Cyclist bikes differently?
* Why would casual riders buy Cyclist annual membership
* How can Cyclist use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
